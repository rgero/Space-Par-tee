# Game Jam 2025
The theme is **Tiny World**

### Idea 1 - Golfing with a Ultimate Chicken Horse vibe
The player is placed on a map with a starting point and a black hole. They place planets of various densities. The player shoots the ball and the gravity of the worlds impact the flight path.
They get points based on the number of planets they use and the number of shots they take to make it into the hole
The only real connection to the theme is that the worlds are physically tiny on the screen so kind of weak.

### Idea 2 - Deity of a Small City
You're the deity of a small city. You control natural events that help/hurt the city.
Like say that a storm comes onto the map, you can try to direct it over the farmlands so it waters the crops or over the city. This could be difficult because I'd need a number of various effects and the city would need some randomness to change its population size/footprint.

### Idea 3 - A game like Raft.
Your world is a small platform or a ship and materials come floating past you. I don't know how to make this different enough from Raft however. 

### Idea 4 - A Delivery Driver
Imagine a small town and you're driving a UPS like truck. You pick up packages from either the Depot or Townfolk and deliver them to other places in the city.

I kind of want something that is very relaxing to play. Something you can put your feet up and chill.
